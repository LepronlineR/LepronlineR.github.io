                    ====================== COLUMNS =========================

    To create a column for multiple articles do this:

    1. Create a folder in the folder and put the description files of each column in it. 
    The file name is the project blog/source/_data/'s :topicid

    source/_data/topic/id.yml
    ```
    name:  Stellar  # A shorter name will be displayed on the breadcrumb navigation 
    title:  Stellar  -  Everyone's independent blog  # The full column title will be displayed on the list page 
    description:  Knowledge and experience sharing related to building an independent blog, as well as advanced usage of  Stellar  and notes on version updates. 
    order_by:  -date  # The default is to sort in reverse order by release date
    ```

    2. Publish an article 
    ```
    --- 
    title:  This is the title of the article 
    topic:  id  # This is the column id, corresponding to blog/source/_data/topic/id.yml 
    ---

    Article Content
    ```
