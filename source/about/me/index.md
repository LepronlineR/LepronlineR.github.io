{% quot icon:hashtag Hobbies %}

I have plenty of random hobbies, here is a list of some of them

### Hiking & Bouldering

I like to have some "nice" walks outside every so often and get good views of nature, especially mountains or high viewpoints like fire towers. Furthermore, I have been bouldering at my "local" gym at Vital Brooklyn. Here are some pictures of my hiking trips, I hope you enjoy them:

### Guitar

I am somewhat of an intermediate player, have been playing for 2 years. I have a Yamaha PAC012 with a Scarlett Solo (a.k.a. high tier budget player), might do a cover soon and post it on youtube.

### Esports

I played CEVO open back in the day and then the Overwatch League Open Qualifiers. Finally during uni, I played as a team captain for Rainbow 6 Siege in a collegiate league representing RPI, the furthest we got to was the quarterfinals (played in CEA and ECAC). Now I'm don't spend as much time playing games competitively.

### Misc

#### Keyboard Building

I built a few keyboards. However, if you're planning to build a keyboard yourself, it is actually not that much work just to get a custom keyboard built for you by some manufacturer. My current keyboard is a CIDOO ABM098 with the pastel green colors.

#### Model Building

I build gunpla occasionally, it generally takes me a week or so of work to get some done since use a lot of precision in cutting and filing. I will get some pictures up eventually of my builds.
